# -Movie-Data-Analysis-using-Python

Project dives deep into a movie dataset to uncover hidden patterns and trends across genres 🎥, box office revenue 💰, runtime ⏱️, budgets 💵, release years 📅, and audience ratings ⭐. Using Python 🐍 and powerful data analysis libraries like Pandas 🐼, NumPy ➕, Matplotlib 📈, and Seaborn 🎨, the dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized to generate clear, data-driven insights.

📊 Insightful visualizations such as Boxplots reveal how different genres perform in terms of box office collections, highlighting high-revenue genres like Action and Adventure 💥 while showing variability across Drama, Comedy, and Horror 🎭. A Correlation Matrix Heatmap helps identify relationships between numerical features such as budget, runtime, revenue, and release year 🔍, making it easier to understand which factors influence movie success.

💡 Key insights include genre-wise revenue distribution, performance spread across movies, weak-to-moderate correlations between budget and box office, and minimal dependency between runtime and revenue — valuable findings for producers, analysts, and movie enthusiasts alike 🎯.

🚀 This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight storytelling, making it an excellent portfolio project for aspiring data analysts and Python enthusiasts aiming to work with datasets and business-oriented insights.
